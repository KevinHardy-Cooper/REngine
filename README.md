# REngine
Start your REngines!

## Overview
A recommendation engine built with React.js, Node.js, and MySQL to display relevant phone plans based on user habits in invoice data.

## Prerequisites
1. You will need a package manager, such as [npm]. (https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. You will need [Node.js] to execute the backend. (https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. You will need [React.js] to execute the frontend. (https://reactjs.org/)
4. You will need a [MySQL] database instance on your local machine. (https://www.mysql.com/)


##### Helpful Tutorials
1. Getting started with Node.js, and integrating it with MySQL. https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/
2. Getting started with React.js. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/

## Installation
1. Clone this repo to your favourite local directory.
2. (At least on a Mac) _System Preferences_ Turn on MySQL database instance.
3. _Terminal_ Use command line to navigate to the /REngine/src folder.
4. _Terminal_ Use the following command: `node backend.js` to get the backend up and going
5. _Terminal_ Run the following command: `$ npm start` to start the frontend
6. _Your favourite web browser_ Open [localhost:8080] (http://localhost:8080/)
7. Your MySQL database that we will be querying is currently empty.  There are example queries and information commented out at the bottom of backend.js
8. Create a table called customer_invoices with the given columns.  
9. Insert a few sample invoice records.
10. Create a table called phone_plans with the given columns.
11. Insert a few sample phone plan records.

## Live Demo?!
1. Once you have the MySQL instance going, the backend up and rippin', and the frontend rockin' and rollin', hit [localhost:8080] (http://localhost:8080/) for the recommendation engine to start chuggin'!  It will then spit out the best plan for the user to save the most money! C'est fini!
